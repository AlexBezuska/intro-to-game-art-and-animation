### Talent


* Think of something that you are good at...
Were you always good at it or did you have to practice
do you think if you practiced more you would get even better at it

* Drawing and math are the two things I hear people say "I'm not good at that", I think that a lot of the time if they thought about it it might really be that they haven't put the time in to practice and get better at those things. Maybe people who like drawing do it more and then they keep getting better and better at it.

* One thing to remember with art is that you only see the end result of what an artist has made, especially in games. You don't see the different sketches, concepts and changes to the characters the artists have made. also with games you don't see the past games a developer has made.

* angry birds was not the first game that Rovio made, but it was the first one people heard of because it got popular. Rovio worked for 6 years and made 51 unsuccessful games before angry birds. can you name any of them?

* I often follow artists I like online, I see the things they create and I get to see some of the process. But I only see what they choose to share. If you feel like something you make isn't very good you might not want to share it for the world to see. So I don't get to see everything an artist makes, I only see they things they think are their best work - usually.
